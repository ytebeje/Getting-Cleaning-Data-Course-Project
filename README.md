Steps Taken

Step Zero : Read the data and assigned column names for each file
Step One:   Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set. 

STEP TWO:   Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 

STEP THREE: Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

STEP FOUR: Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

STEP FIVE: From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set 
            #with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
